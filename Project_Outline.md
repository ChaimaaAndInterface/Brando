## Core Functionality & User Experience

The primary goal is to create a conversational AI that feels natural and effortless to interact with.

### User Flow
The initial user interaction will be straightforward:
1.  **Access Application**: The user opens the web application, which presents a chat window.
2.  **System Greeting**: The AI provides a welcoming prompt to begin the conversation.
3.  **User Input**: The user types their query or command into the chat box.
4.  **Processing**: The system sends the input to the backend AI for processing.
5.  **AI Response Generation**: The AI interprets the input and formulates a text response.
6.  **Display Response**: The AI's reply appears in the chat window.
7.  **Continuous Conversation**: The user can continue the conversation by repeating steps.

Future enhancements will include conversational memory, clarification prompts for ambiguous queries, and the ability to execute simple actions.

## Technical Stack

The project will utilize a modern, scalable technical stack designed for AI applications.

* **Frontend**: **React.js** for building a snappy and interactive user interface.
* **Backend**: **Python**, using the **Flask** framework for its simplicity in building the required RESTful APIs.

* **Key Tasks**:
    * [cite_start]Integrate Google Analytics for frontend user tracking[cite: 496].
    * [cite_start]Build an in-app user feedback form and connect it to Firestore[cite: 497].
    * [cite_start]Develop scripts for basic conversation analytics[cite: 498].
    * [cite_start]Begin exploring basic intent recognition using NLP libraries[cite: 499].

### [cite_start]Phase 4: Future Enhancements & Polish (Ongoing) [cite: 501]

* **Goal**: Make the AI more intelligent and sophisticated.
* **Key Tasks**:
    * [cite_start]Work on context retention to allow for more natural follow-up questions[cite: 502].
    * [cite_start]Implement clarification capabilities for when the AI is confused[cite: 503].
    * [cite_start]Explore adding actionable responses (e.g., "show me the weather")[cite: 504].
    * [cite_start]Continuously refine AI models based on analytics and user feedback[cite: 505].

## Key Architecture & Design

### Database Architecture

[cite_start]A **NoSQL (document-oriented) database** is the chosen approach due to its flexibility for storing evolving conversation structures and its ability to scale easily[cite: 213, 215, 216]. [cite_start]Migrating from NoSQL to a rigid SQL schema in the future would present significant challenges, including schema mismatch, complex data migration, and application-level rewrites[cite: 225, 226, 227].

Our proposed Firestore structure includes the following collections:
* [cite_start]`users`: Stores user credentials like unique IDs, emails, and encrypted passwords[cite: 233].
* [cite_start]`conversations`: Each document represents a complete chat session, potentially containing an array of message objects[cite: 234].
* [cite_start]`analytics_logs`: Stores raw conversation data for later analysis[cite: 237].
* [cite_start]`feedback`: Contains all user-submitted feedback[cite: 238].

### Dialogue Engine

The dialogue engine will evolve through two stages:
1.  [cite_start]**Rules & Keyword Matching**: Initially, the engine will use pre-defined rules to find keywords or patterns in user input and trigger a corresponding response[cite: 308, 309, 310].
2.  [cite_start]**Basic Intent Recognition**: Later, a simple text classification model will be used to categorize user input into "intents" (e.g., "greet," "ask_order_status"), with each intent mapped to a specific response[cite: 312, 313, 315].

## Security Measures

[cite_start]Security is a core component from the project's inception[cite: 379].

* [cite_start]**Data Encryption**: All data will be encrypted **in transit** using TLS/SSL and **at rest**, which is handled automatically by Google Firestore[cite: 381, 383, 386].
* **Data Anonymization**: We will minimize the collection of personally identifiable information. [cite_start]User and conversation logs will use randomly generated UUIDs instead of personal details[cite: 388, 390]. [cite_start]We will implement pseudonymization by keeping the `users` collection separate and tightly controlling access[cite: 395].
* **User Authentication**: We will use **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** for stateless authentication. [cite_start]The backend will validate credentials, create a JWT, and send it to the frontend, which will include the JWT in the `Authorization` header for all subsequent API requests[cite: 398, 406].
* [cite_start]**Audit Trail**: Security logs will be maintained to track important events such as login attempts (successful and failed), new user registrations, and API errors[cite: 410, 411]. [cite_start]These logs will be stored in a dedicated system like Google Cloud Logging[cite: 420].

---

## Infrastructure & Deployment

* [cite_start]**Local Development**: We will use **Docker Compose** to simplify the local setup of the frontend and backend services in containers[cite: 352].
* **Deployment**: The application will be deployed to a **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)**. [cite_start]The Python backend will be deployed to **Google Cloud Run** and the React frontend to **Firebase Hosting** or Google Cloud Storage[cite: 354].
* **CI/CD**: A **GitHub Actions** workflow will be configured to automate the build, test, and deployment pipeline. [cite_start]The pipeline will trigger on pushes to the main branch, build Docker images, run tests, and deploy the new versions if all tests pass[cite: 361, 367, 368, 371, 374].
* **Environment Configuration**: Application configuration (API keys, database URLs) will be managed using **environment variables** and will never be hardcoded. [cite_start]`.env` files will be used for local development[cite: 428, 431, 435].
